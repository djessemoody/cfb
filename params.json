First, a randomly generated preseason\r\nranking of all FBS teams is generated. Then win/losses are read in for each week. If a\r\nteam wins against a lower ranked team, nothing happens. If a team wins against a\r\nhigher ranked team, the higher team moves down and the lower teams moves up. The\r\nhigher team moves down the difference in rank divided by 4; the lower team moves\r\nup the difference in rank divided by 4. In both cases they can't move more than\r\n25 spots per win/loss. If a team loses to an FCS team they go to the bottom that\r\nweek. The last week's ranking is saved.\r\n\r\nAfter these 10,000 iterations the last week's ranking is averaged for each team\r\nand is the team's score (lower is better). Teams are then ranked by their scores. \r\nThat is the final ranking. I also provide a standard deviation (which ends up being \r\nquite large in my opinion except for the very worst teams).\r\n\r\nAs a reference, here is what the final ranking would be for the 2013 season:\r\n\r\n**2013 (Final)**\r\n\r\n Rank | Team                      | Avg.
